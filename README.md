# On Books

This is a collection of readings and resources on the past, present, and future of books.
The topic is vast, but the idea here is to identify notable or highly useful books,
articles, and resources that relate to every stage of writing and publishing books—and the
software, tools, and formats supporting the process.
(All in English, at least for now.)

🚧 This list is far from complete.
